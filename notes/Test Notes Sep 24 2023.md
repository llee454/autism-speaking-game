On September 24th, 2023 at 9:30 am, I asked a couple at Charmington's if they would allow their 3 1/2 year old son to test out the space race game.

The child exhibited interest in the game and, after I demonstrated how to control the space ship using the commands "left" and "right," the child tentatively began to parrot commands. Unfortunately, his voice was too soft to be picked up effectively by the microphone and as a result, the space ship rarely responded to his commands. He was too shy to speak up loud enough to be heard by the microphone. Additionally, complicating the trial, he had a slight accent (German-American) that may have complicated the test, however, looking at the logs, it appears that the primary cause of failure was non-detection.

Take aways:
1. Children should be given a microphone when playing the game to ensure that their voice is adequately detected.
2. A neurotypical three year old is able to understand the premise of the game and to pronoun "left" and "right," however they frequently confuse the two and respond slowly. They cannot keep up with the game running at full speed. Add a calibration feature to slow the game down for young children. 
3. The father suggested using a sound capture to calibrate the game for children who speak with a accent or have difficulty pronouncing the words.
